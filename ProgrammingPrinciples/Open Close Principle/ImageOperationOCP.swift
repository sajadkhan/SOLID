//This class is same as ImageOperation.swift except we are tryin to follow Open/Close principle here.

//This is abstraction, Every image operation should process an image and return the result.
//Every operation has its own implementation for processing an image.

//We don't have to modify any class when adding new operation. So we have a closure of change with respect to adding operations. There are other aspect we can think to apply OCP but for scope of this project we are not going to look at them.

    func process(image: UIImage) -> UIImage

    }
    func process(image: UIImage) -> UIImage {
        return UIImage.scale(image: image, by: scale)
    }

///Resize Operation
